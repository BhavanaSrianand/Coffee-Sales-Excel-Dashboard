Project Title: Coffee Sales Dashboard
=
Level: Intermediate
=

=

This project is the replication of Mochen's (@mochen862) "Coffee Orders Project" that was published 2 years ago. 
The main objective of this project is to sharpen all crucial excel techniques from beginner to the advanced level and adding new perspective to the existing credentials. This project involves setting up a Database, filling values in missing columns (using X Lookup, Index and Match functions), generating a pivot table, analysing different parameters,and creating a comprehensive dashboard. It is ideal for those who wish to generate comprehensive dashboards using excel fundamentals.

Objectives
=
1. Database Design: Set up the "Coffee Orders" database integrating Purchases and Customer Data
2. Missing Data: Fill up data in the missing columns
3. Data Analysis: Create a pivot table and analyse different data dimensions
4. Data Visualisation: Create timelines, slicers, line graphs, and bar charts from the pivot table
5. Dashboard Creation: Organise all the data collected and design the dashboard

Project Structure
=
1. Data Base Creation
   =
 The project starts by creating a database on the "Coffee Orders" {Reference sheet: Orders}. This is done by integrating data from the customers as well as the product's sheet where we get data on the customer details and product purchases.

2. Missing Data
   =

 Fill for the missing data columns in the orders sheet using X Lookup, Index, and Match Functions  

Customer's Name, Email ID, and Country columns are filled using X lookup. {Reference sheet in the excel: Customers}

To get data on the Coffee Type,	Roast Type,	Size, and	Unit Price, we use Index and Match Functions to get all values at once. {Reference sheet in the excel: Products}

In addition to these column to get the "Full Name" and avoid abbreviations, 2 additional columns are generated for the "Coffee Type" and "Roast Type Name".
Values are filled using the IF condition.

6. Project Uses
   =
To analyse segment wise sales at different points of time
Draw inferences from the entire data as well as from the segment wise representation and make parallels

7. Best use trick
   =
Adjust the timeframe, then modifty the slicers accordingly to get accurate representation

8. Conclusion
   =
From Data Entry and Organisation, to designing comprehensive dashboards using advanced excel settings, this project helps in learning crucial excel skills that are highly essential for data analytics and visualisation.
