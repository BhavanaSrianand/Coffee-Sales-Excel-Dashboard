This project is the replication of Mochen's (@mochen862) "Coffee Orders Project" that was published 2 years ago. 
The main objective of this project is to sharpen all crucial excel techniques from beginner to the advanced level and adding new perspective to the existing findings. This project involves setting up a Database, filling values in missing columns (using X Lookup, Index and Match functions), generating a pivot table, analysing different parameters,and creating a comprehensive dashboard. It is ideal for those who wish to generate comprehensive dashboards using excel fundamentals.

1. Database Design: Set up the "Coffee Orders" database integrating Purchases and Customer Data
2. Data Cleaning: Account for missing columns in the data
3. Data Analysis: Create a pivot table and analyse different data dimensions
4. Data Visualisation: Create timelines, slicers, line graphs, and bar charts from the pivot table
5. Implications: Draw inferences from the data visuals generated
